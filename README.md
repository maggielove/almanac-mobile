This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

The most recent version of the Create React Native guide is available [here](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app/blob/master/react-native-scripts/template/README.md).

## Development
This app uses the Weather Underground API. To use it, you can sign up for an [API key](https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/), create a `.config.js` file locally, and add it there. (The .config.js file is already listed in .gitignore.)
